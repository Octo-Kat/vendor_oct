These are stubbie manifest fragments.  They are used by the repo system to
manifest the build.  

oct.xml represents the core OctOs repos
cm.xml is for CM-based repos

Others will be added in without header or footer tag! (No <manifest> or <xml> tags!)

These fragments are auto-enumerated and can be called by filename as arguments.

sam.xml = sam
nex.xml = nex

etc.  

Be aware!  This will only give you what you ASK for as far as device tree, and nothing else!
